Hi there!
Thank you for visiting my Python projects. This repository highlights my data analytics skills using libraries such as Pandas and Matplotlib.
Inside each folder, youâ€™ll find practical use cases including:
- Data indexing and sorting
- Filtering techniques
- Grouping and reshaping data

I recently applied these techniques in a 2025 Los Angeles Crime Analysis project, where I explored trends and patterns to derive meaningful insights from real-world data.

I'm passionate about turning data into actionable insights!  Enjoy exploring the projects!
